# Project Overview  
**“From Dive Tracking to Social Sharing”**  
Freedivah is an interactive platform for freedivers to mark and share their dive locations on a world map using national flag icons. It combines freediving with technology, allowing users to track their dives, create a personalized map, and connect with other divers.

The name 'Freedivah' blends 'freediving' with my identity as a developer, reflecting my journey and enthusiasm for underwater exploration.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Dive Map**: Users can mark their dive locations on a world map.
- **Sharing and Connecting**: Users can share their experiences and connect with other divers.
- **Tracking and Documentation**: Keep a record of dives across different countries.

## Development Considerations

### 1. **Creating a "Screaming Architecture" from a Domain Perspective**
   - Using FSD (Feature-Sliced Design) to build a feature-driven architecture aligned with the domain, ensuring single-direction dependencies for enhanced flexibility and scalability.

### 2. **Designing Decoupled Systems**
   - **Ensuring** a clean separation of concerns between business logic, UI, and side effects to maintain flexibility and scalability.
   - **Using** SOLID principles to design modular, maintainable components and multi-paradigm design to provide a flexible system structure.
